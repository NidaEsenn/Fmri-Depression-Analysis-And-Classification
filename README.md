Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-based model that can classify individuals as either depressed or not depressed based on their brain activity patterns captured through fMRI. The goal is to contribute to the field of mental health diagnostics by providing an automated and non-invasive method for depression detection.

Key Objectives:
Preprocess fMRI data for use in machine learning models.
Build and train classification models to detect depression.
Evaluate model performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Data
The dataset used in this project consists of fMRI scans from subjects with and without depression. The data includes brain activity patterns captured during a series of tasks designed to activate regions related to mood regulation, cognitive processing, and emotional response.

Data Source:
[Link to dataset](insert link if available)
Format: .nii, .csv, .mat (depending on your data format)
Data Preprocessing:
Motion correction
Spatial normalization
Temporal filtering
Feature extraction (e.g., brain region activation maps)
Modeling Approach
In this project, various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were explored for classification, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Each model was trained on preprocessed fMRI data and evaluated to determine the best approach for classification.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
NiBabel (for handling fMRI data in NIfTI format)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
NumPy / Pandas (for data manipulation)
Installation:
Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fmri-depression-classification.git
cd fmri-depression-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After setting up the environment, you can run the project with the following command:

bash
Kodu kopyala
python main.py
This will:

Load and preprocess the fMRI data.
Train the selected machine learning or deep learning model.
Output the classification results.
You can also modify the config.py file to change model parameters and experiment with different settings.

Results
The project provides detailed results, including:

Model accuracy and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
Confusion matrices and ROC curves for visual evaluation
Performance comparison of different models
